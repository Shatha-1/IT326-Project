## Depression Student Dataset

---

## Project Description
This project focuses on understanding the issue of depression among students and the different factors that may contribute to it.  
The dataset we collected provides information about students’ daily habits, academic life, and personal background, such as sleep duration, study pressure, satisfaction with studies, and lifestyle.  

By analyzing these data, the project aims to identify possible reasons behind depression and provide insights that could help in understanding and addressing mental health challenges faced by students.

## Objectives
- **Classification:** Predict whether a student is likely to experience depression based on their demographic, academic, and lifestyle attributes.  
- **Clustering:** Group students into clusters based on similarities in study habits, stress levels, and lifestyle patterns to identify hidden mental health risk patterns.

## Problem Statement
Depression has become one of the most common challenges facing students today.  
Many suffer from academic pressure, lack of sleep, financial stress, or personal issues that may negatively affect their mental health.  
However, it is not always clear which factors play the biggest role in increasing the risk of depression.  
This project addresses the problem of identifying and understanding the key factors that could lead students to experience depression.

## Motivation
Depression among students is not just an individual problem but a growing social concern that can affect entire communities.  
It often remains unnoticed until it reaches a critical stage, leading to serious consequences on students’ health, relationships, and academic futures.  
Our motivation for this project comes from the urgent need to shed light on how everyday factors like sleep quality, study pressure, or financial stress silently shape students’ mental health.  
By understanding these hidden patterns, we hope to emphasize the importance of early awareness and to support efforts aimed at reducing depression and improving students’ well-being.
